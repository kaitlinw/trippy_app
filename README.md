# trippy travel

An exciting project called Trippy. With a mobile first design, Trippy is the perfect travel planner app for all of your trips.
Please view from a mobile device!

Trippy has essential CRUD functionality.

Check out the app here (and switch to mobile view: Cmd+Option+I):[TRIPPY!](https://trippy-travel.herokuapp.com/)

### Approach to solving
Given the final app will hold a lot of data, it seemed essential to have user logins, especially considering the app doesnt offer any public functionality just yet. 


### Future Development
Still to be developed:

- day to day trip itinerary CRUD functionality.
- day to day "during trip" view functionality that is determined by the day's date and timezone.
- page transition animations.
- go back buttons and minimum form requirements.
- linking your friends functionality with tables.
- computer and ipad screen size css styling.
